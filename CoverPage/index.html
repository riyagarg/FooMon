                <p>Apart from numeric metrices, foomon also hosts an elasticsearch instance and a kibana dashboard where logs from various applications are steamlined and and is indexed for querying. The logs are available as soon as you produce them , making it super easy to query them in case of issues or when you want to make reports out of them in terms of charts</p>

                <h4>The whole thing is supported by filebeat, which also makes sure you are not overloading the elasticsearch intance</h4>

                <p>UI developers and product owners alike, loves to know what part of the product are users using the most. And hence we pay heap analytics annually to store this data.</p>
                <h4>What if we could do that inhouse and not send our data over to a third party?</h4>
                <h2>Well we did just that !</h2>
                <p>We capture events, and stream them to the elasticsearch</p>
                <p>And those events are now at our disposal to be queried and made charts out of them </p>
